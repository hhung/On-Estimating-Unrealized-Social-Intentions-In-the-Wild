TITLE={Gaze-Based Intention Estimation for Shared Autonomy in Pick-and-Place Tasks},      
JOURNAL={Frontiers in Neurorobotics},      
VOLUME={15},

ABSTRACT={Shared autonomy aims at combining robotic and human control in the execution of remote, teleoperated tasks. This cooperative interaction cannot be brought about without the robot first recognizing the current human intention in a fast and reliable way so that a suitable assisting plan can be quickly instantiated and executed. Eye movements have long been known to be highly predictive of the cognitive agenda unfolding during manual tasks and constitute, hence, the earliest and most reliable behavioral cues for intention estimation. In this study, we present an experiment aimed at analyzing human behavior in simple teleoperated pick-and-place tasks in a simulated scenario and at devising a suitable model for early estimation of the current proximal intention. We show that scan paths are, as expected, heavily shaped by the current intention and that two types of Gaussian Hidden Markov Models, one more scene-specific and one more action-specific, achieve a very good prediction performance, while also generalizing to new users and spatial arrangements. We finally discuss how behavioral and model results suggest that eye movements reflect to some extent the invariance and generality of higher-level planning across object configurations, which can be leveraged by cooperative robotic systems.}

    abstract = { This review synthesizes the historical literature on the criminalization and incarceration of black Americans for an interdisciplinary audience. Drawing on key insights from new histories in the field of American carceral studies, we trace the multifaceted ways in which policymakers and officials at all levels of government have used criminal law, policing, and imprisonment as proxies for exerting social control in predominantly black communities from the colonial era to the present. By underscoring this antiblack punitive tradition in America as central to the development of crime-control strategies and mass incarceration, our review lends vital historical context to ongoing discussions, research, and experimentation within criminology and other fields concerned about the long-standing implications of institutional racism, violence, and inequity entrenched in the administration of criminal justice in the United States from the top down and the ground up. }

abstract = {Integrating evolutionary signaling theory with a social attention approach, we argue that individuals possess a fast, automated mechanism for detecting leadership signals in fellow humans that is reflected in higher visual attention toward emergent leaders compared to non-leaders. To test this notion, we first videotaped meetings of project teams and collected leadership ratings for the team members from three rating sources. Second, we provided 18 naïve observers with 42 brief, muted video clips of the team meetings and analyzed their eye gazing patterns. Observers gazed at emergent leaders more often, and for an average longer duration, than at non-leaders. Gender effects occurred such that male emergent leaders received a higher number of fixations than female emergent leaders. Non-verbal behavior analysis indicated that emergent leaders showed a higher amount of active gestures and less passive facial expressions than non-leaders. We discuss theoretical and methodological directions for emergent leadership research in teams.}

@article{Decety2004,
abstract = {Empathy accounts for the naturally occurring subjective experience of similarity between the feelings expressed by self and others without loosing sight of whose feelings belong to whom. Empathy involves not only the affective experience of the other person's actual or inferred emotional state but also some minimal recognition and understanding of another's emotional state. In light of multiple levels of analysis ranging from developmental psychology, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical neuropsychology, this article proposes a model of empathy that involves parallel and distributed processing in a number of dissociable computational mechanisms. Shared neural representations, self-awareness, mental flexibility, and emotion regulation constitute the basic macrocomponents of empathy, which are underpinned by specific neural systems. This functional model may be used to make specific predictions about the various empathy deficits that can be encountered in different forms of social and neurological disorders.},

abstract = {What do our eyes do when we are focused on internal representations such as during imagination or planning? Evidence from mind wandering research suggests that spontaneous shifts from externally directed cognition (EDC) to internally directed cognition (IDC) involves oculomotor changes indicative of visual disengagement. In the present study, we investigated potential differences in eye behavior between goal-directed forms of IDC and EDC. To this end, we manipulated the focus of attention (internal versus external) in two demanding cognitive tasks (anagram and sentence generation). IDC was associated with fewer and longer fixations and higher variability in pupil diameter and eye vergence compared to EDC, suggesting reduced visual scanning and higher spontaneous eye activity. IDC was further related to longer blinks, lower microsaccade frequency, and a lower angle of eye vergence. These latter changes appear conducive to attenuate visual input and thereby shield ongoing internal processes from external distraction. Together, these findings suggest that IDC is accompanied by characteristic eye behavior that reflects a decoupling of attention from external events and serves gating out visual input.},

abstract = {Eye behavior is increasingly used as an indicator of internal versus external focus of attention both in research and application. However, available findings are partly inconsistent, which might be attributed to the different nature of the employed types of internal and external cognition tasks. The present study, therefore, investigated how consistently different eye parameters respond to internal versus external attentional focus across three task modalities: numerical, verbal, and visuo-spatial. Three eye parameters robustly differentiated between internal and external attentional focus across all tasks. Blinks, pupil diameter variance, and fixation disparity variance were consistently increased during internally directed attention. We also observed substantial attentional focus effects on other parameters (pupil diameter, fixation disparity, saccades, and microsaccades), but they were moderated by task type. Single-trial analysis of our data using machine learning techniques further confirmed our results: Classifying the focus of attention by means of eye tracking works well across participants, but generalizing across tasks proves to be challenging. Based on the effects of task type on eye parameters, we discuss what eye parameters are best suited as indicators of internal versus external attentional focus in different settings.},

abstract = {Intention recognition is the process of using behavioural cues, such as deliberative actions, eye gaze, and gestures, to infer an agent's goals or future behaviour. In artificial intelligence, one approach for intention recognition is to use a model of possible behaviour to rate intentions as more likely if they are a better ‘fit’ to actions observed so far. In this paper, we draw from literature linking gaze and visual attention, and we propose a novel model of online human intention recognition that combines gaze and model-based AI planning to build probability distributions over a set of possible intentions. In human-behavioural experiments (n=40) involving a multi-player board game, we demonstrate that adding gaze-based priors to model-based intention recognition improved the accuracy of intention recognition by 22% (p<0.05), determined those intentions ≈90 seconds earlier (p<0.05), and at no additional computational cost. We also demonstrate that, when evaluated in the presence of semi-rational or deceptive gaze behaviours, the proposed model is significantly more accurate (9% improvement) (p<0.05) compared to a model-based or gaze only approaches. Our results indicate that the proposed model could be used to design novel human-agent interactions in cases when we are unsure whether a person is honest, deceitful, or semi-rational.}

abstract = {Estimating a silent participant's degree of engagement and his role within a group discussion can be challenging, as there are no speech related cues available at the given time. Having this information available, however, can provide important insights into the dynamics of the group as a whole. In this paper, we study the classification of listeners into several categories (attentive listener, side participant and bystander). We devised a thin-sliced perception test where subjects were asked to assess listener roles and engagement levels in 15-second video-clips taken from a corpus of group interviews. Results show that humans are usually able to assess silent participant roles. Using the annotation to identify from a set of multimodal low-level features, such as past speaking activity, backchannels (both visual and verbal), as well as gaze patterns, we could identify the features which are able to distinguish between different listener categories. Moreover, the results show that many of the audio-visual effects observed on listeners in dyadic interactions, also hold for multi-party interactions. A preliminary classifier achieves an accuracy of 64 %.},

The present study compared students' predicted, on-line, and remembered spring-break experiences, as well as the influence of these factors on students' desire to take a similar vacation in the future. Predicted and remembered experiences were both more positive - and, paradoxically, more negative - than on-line experiences. Of key importance, path analyses revealed that remembered experience, but neither on-line nor anticipated experience, directly predicted the desire to repeat the experience. These results suggest that although on-line measures may be superior to retrospective measures for approximating objective experience, retrospective measures may be superior for predicting choice.},

   abstract = {This article provides an overview of a novel ecological momentary assessment method called the electronically activated recorder or EAR. The EAR is a portable audio recorder that periodically records snippets of ambient sounds from participants’ momentary environments. In tracking moment-to-moment ambient sounds, the EAR yields an acoustic log of a person’s day as it naturally unfolds. As a naturalistic observation method, it provides an observer’s account of daily life and is optimized for the assessment of audible aspects of participants’ daily social environ- ments and interactions. The article discusses the EAR method conceptually and metho- dologically and identifies three important ways in which it can enrich social health research. Specifically, it can help cross-validate research findings independent of self-reports, calibrate psychological measures against behavioral markers of real-world social functioning, and further our understanding of the role that people’s mundane social interactions and language use play in coping and health.},

Thanks to the tremendous advancement of smartphone technologies, platforms, as well as the enthusiasm of individual developers, numerous mobile applications (apps) have been created to serve a wide range of usage purposes, making our daily life more convenient. While these apps are used, data logs are typically generated and ambience context is recorded forming a rich data source of the smartphone users’ behaviors. In this paper, we survey existing studies on mining smartphone data for uncovering app usage patterns leveraging such a data source. Our discussions of the studies are organized according to two main research streams, namely app usage prediction and app recommendations alongside a few other related studies. Finally, we also present several challenges and opportunities in the emerging area of mining smartphone usage patterns.}

Robots are likely to become important social actors in our future and so require more human-like ways of assisting us. We state that collaboration between humans and robots is fostered by two cognitive skills: intention reading and trust. An agent possessing these abilities would be able to infer the non-verbal intentions of others and to evaluate how likely they are to achieve their goals, jointly understanding what kind and which degree of collaboration they require. For this reason, we propose a developmental artificial cognitive architecture that integrates unsupervised machine learning and probabilistic models to imbue a humanoid robot with intention reading and trusting capabilities. Our experimental results show that the synergistic implementation of these cognitive skills enable the robot to cooperate in a meaningful way, with the intention reading model allowing a correct goal prediction and with the trust component enhancing the likelihood of a positive outcome for the task.}

   abstract = {Human-robot interaction (HRI) is the key capability for assistive robots to provide support for the elders and impaired in daily activities. Implicit intention understanding is a challenge problem for natural and intuitive HRI. In this paper, an implicit intention inference framework based on gaze behavior is proposed. First, support vector machine classifier is used to classify human’s gaze behavior as intentional and unintentional visual behavior. Then, a Naive Bayes model based on implicit intention inference is presented with taking historical visual attention into accounts. The advantage of this model is that the human’s implicit intention could be inferred based on his/her gaze at multiple objects by dealing with the historical information of visual behavior. Finally, experiments are conducted in a scenario of “home care in the kitchen”. People are free to look at one or more objects among 14 kinds of objects provided in experiment. With the proposed model, four kinds of intentions could be inferred based on people’s historical gaze on objects. The experiment results validate that the proposed model, which considers the historical information of visual behavior, outperforms the previous gaze-based intention inference methods.},

abstract = {Big data is having a disruptive impact across the sciences. Human annotation of semantic interpretation tasks is a critical part of big data semantics, but it is based on an antiquated ideal of a single correct truth that needs to be similarly disrupted. We expose seven myths about human annotation, most of which derive from that antiquated ideal of truth, and dispel these myths with examples from our research. We propose a new theory of truth, crowd truth, that is based on the intuition that human interpretation is subjective, and that measuring annotations on the same objects of interpretation (in our examples, sentences) across a crowd will provide a useful representation of their subjectivity and the range of reasonable interpretations.},

abstract = {Interaction group detection has been previously addressed with bottom-up approaches which relied on the position and orientation information of individuals. These approaches were primarily based on pairwise affinity matrices and were limited to static, third-person views. This problem can greatly benefit from a holistic approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) beyond pairwise relationships, due to the inherent spatial configuration that exists between individuals who form interaction groups. Our proposed method, GROup detection With Link prediction (GROWL), demonstrates the effectiveness of a GNN based approach. GROWL predicts the link between two individuals by generating a feature embedding based on their neighbourhood in the graph and determines whether they are connected with a shallow binary classification method such as Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs). We test our method against other state-of-the-art group detection approaches on both a third-person view dataset and a robocentric (i.e., egocentric) dataset. In addition, we propose a multimodal approach based on RGB and depth data to calculate a representation GROWL can utilise as input. Our results show that a GNN based approach can significantly improve accuracy across different camera views, i.e., third-person and egocentric views.},

abstract = {We study conversational group detection in varied social scenes using a message-passing Graph Neural Network (GNN) in combination with the Dominant Sets clustering algorithm. Our approach first describes a scene as an interaction graph, where nodes encode individual features and edges encode pairwise relationship data. Then, it uses a GNN to predict pairwise affinity values that represent the likelihood of two people interacting together, and computes non-overlapping group assignments based on these affinities. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Cocktail Party and MatchNMingle datasets. Our results suggest that using GNNs to leverage both individual and relationship features when computing groups is beneficial, especially when more features are available for each individual.},

	abstract = {Data collected from mobile phones have the potential to provide insight
	into the relational dynamics of individuals. This paper compares
	observational data from mobile phones with standard self-report survey
	data. We find that the information from these two data sources is
	overlapping but distinct. For example, self-reports of physical proximity
	deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience
	of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately
	infer 95\% of friendships based on the observational data alone,
	where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns
	in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral
	patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes
	such as job satisfaction.},

   abstract = {Most current Artificial Intelligence applications are based on supervised Machine Learning (ML), which ultimately grounds on data annotated by small teams of experts or large ensemble of volunteers. The annotation process is often performed in terms of a majority vote, however this has been proved to be often problematic by recent evaluation studies.
In this article, we describe and advocate for a different paradigm, which we call perspectivism: this counters the removal of disagreement and, consequently, the assumption of correctness of traditionally aggregated gold-standard datasets, and proposes the adoption of methods that preserve divergence of opinions and integrate multiple perspectives in the ground truthing process of ML development. Drawing on previous works which inspired it, mainly from the crowdsourcing and multi-rater labeling settings, we survey the state-of-the-art and describe the potential of our proposal for not only the more subjective tasks (e.g. those related to human language) but also those tasks commonly understood as objective (e.g. medical decision making). We present the main benefits of adopting a perspectivist stance in ML, as well as possible disadvantages, and various ways in which such a stance can be implemented in practice. Finally, we share a set of recommendations and outline a research agenda to advance the perspectivist stance in ML.},

@article{Alhasan2023,
   abstract = {Intention prediction often plays a crucial role in successful social interaction. Previous studies have attempted to understand this skill by focusing on the role of movement kinematics in isolation. However, this approach is limited as the same kinematics typically map to multiple action possibilities (affordances) and as a result, individual's also employ contextual information to predict others' intentions. In this study we present preliminary findings from a qualitative study aimed at investigating intention prediction in naturalistic contexts. Participants viewed an individual reaching for a cup with one of two object-directed intentions: to drink OR to clear the table. A third non-object-directed intention was also included where the observed individual placed their hand on the table next to the cup. For each intention the contextual information was varied by changing the environmental scene between (1) cups full of juice, (2) almost empty cups, and (3) half-empty cups. The findings reveal that participants perceived the cup's functional (most salient) affordance - drink - for the intention so far as the movement kinematics specified an object-directed intention (drink or clear) with a context that clearly afforded it (full and half-full cups). However, participants were also sensitive to the kinematic differences between the object-directed intentions when the context made the functional affordance seem improbable (almost empty cups).},

@article{Ridderinkhof2022,
   abstract = {The key to action control is one’s ability to adequately predict the consequences of one’s actions. Predictive processing theories assume that forward models enable rapid “preplay” to assess the match between predicted and intended action effects. Here we propose the novel hypothesis that “reading” another’s action intentions requires a rich forward model of that agent’s action. Such a forward model can be obtained and enriched through learning by either practice or simulation. Based on this notion, we ran a series of studies on soccer goalkeepers and novices, who predicted the intended direction of penalties being kicked at them in a computerized penalty-reading task. In line with hypotheses, extensive practice in penalty kicking improved performance in penalty reading among goalkeepers who had extensive prior experience in penalty blocking but not in penalty kicking. A robust benefit in penalty reading did not result from practice in kinesthetic motor imagery of penalty kicking in novice participants. To test whether goalkeepers actually use such penalty-kicking imagery in penalty reading, we trained a machine-learning classifier on multivariate fMRI activity patterns to distinguish motor-imagery-related from attention-related strategies during a penalty-imagery training task. We then applied that classifier to fMRI data related to a separate penalty-reading task and showed that 2/3 of all correctly read penalty kicks were classified as engaging the motor-imagery circuit rather than merely the attention circuit. This study provides initial evidence that, in order to read our opponent’s action intention, it helps to observe their action kinematics, and use our own forward model to predict the sensory consequences of “our” penalty kick if we were to produce these action kinematics ourselves. In sum, it takes practice as a penalty kicker to become a penalty killer.},

	abstract = {In a previous investigation, we demonstrated the role of questions
	as an instructional resource in the social construction of conversation
	by depriving conversationalists of their use. The resulting conversational
	structure, measured in terms of the ability of third parties to reconstruct
	the dialogues after they had been randomized, was impaired. The importance
	of culturally shared knowledge for the reconstruction (and by implication
	the construction) task was apparent in the superiority of British
	over Canadian subjects in reconstructing unconstrained British dialogues.
	The present study was concerned with the effects of privately shared
	knowledge on the construction of conversation. Conversational structure
	and the frequency of questions were greater in strangers' than in
	mutual acquaintances' unconstrained dialogues. Strangers' dialogues,
	but not those of mutual acquaintances, were disrupted under a ban
	on questions. The results were taken to indicate that strangers need
	to provide one another with continual instruction in how to proceed,
	whereas mutual acquaintances, in virtue of their privately shared
	social knowledge, can construct orderly dialogue with less moment-to-moment
	guidance.},

title = "Same talk, different reaction? Communication, emergent leadership and gender",
abstract = "Purpose: We investigate the role of gender in linking communicative acts that occur in the interactions of self-managed teams to emergent leadership. Specifically, this study presents a framework that differentiates between agentic and communal task- and relations-oriented communication as predictors of emergent leadership, and it hypothesizes that men and women do not differ in what they say but do differ in how they are rewarded (i.e. ascribed informal leadership responsibilities) for their statements. Design/methodology/approach: Interaction coding was used to capture the meeting communication of 116 members of 41 self-managed teams. Findings: Men and women exhibited the same amount of agentic and communal task- and relations-oriented communication and were equally likely to emerge as leaders. However, men experienced an emergent leadership advantage when engaging in agentic and communal task-oriented behaviors. Agentic and communal relations-oriented behaviors did not predict emergent leadership. Research limitations/implications: The findings imply that theories could be more precise in differentiating between objective behaviors (i.e. actor perspective) and perceptions thereof (i.e. observer perspective) to understand why women experience a disadvantage in assuming leadership roles. Practical implications: Although women displayed the same verbal behaviors as men, they experienced different consequences. Organizations can provide unconscious bias training programs, which help increase employees' self-awareness of a potential positive assessment bias toward men's communication. Originality/value: This research utilizes an innovative, fine-grained coding approach to gather data that add to previous studies showing that, unlike men, women experience a disadvantage in terms of emergent leadership ascriptions when they deviate from stereotypically expected behavior.",

ABSTRACT={To realize a successful and collaborative interaction between human and robots remains a big challenge. Emotional reactions of the user provide crucial information for a successful interaction. These reactions carry key factors to prevent errors and fatal bidirectional misunderstanding. In cases where human–machine interaction does not proceed as expected, negative emotions, like frustration, can arise. Therefore, it is important to identify frustration in a human–machine interaction and to investigate its impact on other influencing factors such as dominance, sense of control and task performance. This paper presents a study that investigates a close cooperative work situation between human and robot, and explore the influence frustration has on the interaction. The task for the participants was to hand over colored balls to two different robot systems (an anthropomorphic robot and a robotic arm). The robot systems had to throw the balls into appropriate baskets. The coordination between human and robot was controlled by various gestures and words by means of trial and error. Participants were divided into two groups, a frustration- (FRUST) and a no frustration- (NOFRUST) group. Frustration was induced by the behavior of the robotic systems which made errors during the ball handover. Subjective and objective methods were used. The sample size of participants was N = 30 and the study was conducted in a between-subject design. Results show clear differences in perceived frustration in the two condition groups and different behavioral interactions were shown by the participants. Furthermore, frustration has a negative influence on interaction factors such as dominance and sense of control. The study provides important information concerning the influence of frustration on human–robot interaction (HRI) for the requirements of a successful, natural, and social HRI. The results (qualitative and quantitative) are discussed in favor of how a successful und effortless interaction between human and robot can be realized and what relevant factors, like appearance of the robot and influence of frustration on sense of control, have to be regarded.}

abstract = {A service robot can provide a smoother interaction experience if it has the ability to proactively detect whether a nearby user intends to interact, in order to adapt its behavior e.g. by explicitly showing that it is available to provide a service. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to predict the probability that a human user will interact with a robot before the interaction actually begins; the approach is self-supervised because after each encounter with a human, the robot can automatically label it depending on whether it resulted in an interaction or not. We explore different classification approaches, using different sets of features considering the pose and the motion of the user. We validate and deploy the approach in three scenarios. The first collects 3442 natural sequences (both interacting and non-interacting) representing employees in an office break area: a real-world, challenging setting, where we consider a coffee machine in place of a service robot. The other two scenarios represent researchers interacting with service robots (200 and 72 sequences, respectively). Results show that, even in challenging real-world settings, our approach can learn without external supervision, and can achieve accurate classification (i.e. AUROC greater than 0.9) of the user’s intention to interact with an advance of more than 3 s before the interaction actually occurs.}

abstract = {The ability to understand and manage social signals of a person we are communicating with is the core of social intelligence. Social intelligence is a facet of human intelligence that has been argued to be indispensable and perhaps the most important for success in life. This paper argues that next-generation computing needs to include the essence of social intelligence – the ability to recognize human social signals and social behaviours like turn taking, politeness, and disagreement – in order to become more effective and more efficient. Although each one of us understands the importance of social signals in everyday life situations, and in spite of recent advances in machine analysis of relevant behavioural cues like blinks, smiles, crossed arms, laughter, and similar, design and development of automated systems for social signal processing (SSP) are rather difficult. This paper surveys the past efforts in solving these problems by a computer, it summarizes the relevant findings in social psychology, and it proposes a set of recommendations for enabling the development of the next generation of socially aware computing.}

abstract = {Developing computational models for automatic affect prediction requires valid self-reports about individuals' emotional interpretations of stimuli. In this article, we highlight the important influence of the temporal distance between a stimulus event and the moment when its experience is reported on the provided information's validity. This influence stems from the time-dependent and time-demanding nature of the involved cognitive processes. As such, reports can be collected too late: forgetting is a widely acknowledged challenge for accurate descriptions of past experience. For this reason, methods striving for assessment as early as possible have become increasingly popular. However, here we argue that collection may also occur too early: descriptions about very recent stimuli might be collected before emotional processing has fully converged. Based on these notions, we champion the existence of a temporal distance for each type of stimulus that maximizes the validity of self-reports – a "right" time. Consequently, we recommend future research to (1) consciously consider the potential influence of temporal distance on affective self-reports when planning data collection, (2) document the temporal distance of affective self-reports wherever possible as part of corpora for computational modelling, and finally (3) and explore the effect of temporal distance on self-reports across different types of stimuli.},
